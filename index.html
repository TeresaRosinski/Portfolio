        <p>Hey there! </p>
        <p> My name is Teresa Rosinski and I am excited to share a bit about myself
          with you. 
        </p>
        <p>For starters, I would consider myself an explorer. I love to explore places, 
          ideas and knowledge. My dream as a child was to travel around the world. The first 
          time I had the opportunity to do that was in university. I spent six months of junior year
          in Santiago, Chile. It was a fully-immersive program and I thought I could learn Spanish on the 
          plane ride there. Not surprisingly, it was a rough start. However, with a lot of help, persistence, 
          and dedication, I eventually learned how to communicate and build meaningful realtionships. 
        </p>
        <p> After college I moved to Colombia to teach English. However, with my student debt, 
        I couldn't afford to stay there long. This hiccup is what inspired my move to South Korea. 
        Korea is an <em>incredible</em> place to teach while making enough money to pay off student loans. 
        The country itself is beautiful - 70% moutains, safe, and fun. The culture is generally welcoming
        and there is a strong value placed on learning. Which is <strong>fantastic</strong> for growth mindset
        oriented people. 
        </p>
        <p>After about 4 years I got that itch that it was time to move forward. You know when everything is going
        well but you have that feeling that you're getting too comfortable? Or that there is something
        more fore you to experience? That's what I had. When my final contract expired, I packed my bags and flew to 
        Europe to learn about how people are solving some of the greatest problems we face today - climate change and 
        the refugee crisis.
        </p>
        <p> With my younger sister Emma, I volunteered with organizations taking part to solve these issues. We harvested fruits and practiced 
         meditation on a self-sustainable, spiritual farm in Portugal. And cleaned showers at a female refugee center in Lesbos, Greece.  Both experiences left us 
         in a state of awe and admiration. 
        </p>
        <p>Now I am living in Chicago and learning how to code. Someone once told me that <em>'Every company is a 
         software company'.</em> Our current society is built on software and I'm excited to learn the skills needed
         to build a career in this field. 
        </p>
        
        <p>Thanks for reading this! <p>
        <p><em>-Teresa</em> </p>
